# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-Text-Classification-

This repository contains code and blog on how to build a Naive-Bayes Classifier(NBC) on text data without using any external modules i.e., to build from scratch in python. By using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, given a new sentence we are supposed to find out which type this sentence belongs to using bayes theorem. 

## Dataset

The Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaveshjain/ford-sentence-classifiaction-dataset). You need a Kaggle account to download the dataset. This dataset consists corpus of text data related to 6 different categories. They are Responsibility, Requirement, Soft Skill, Experience, Skill and Education. 

## Usage

code is in the form of jupyter notebook. You can run the notebook using the following command:

    jupyter notebook

It will open the jupyter notebook in your browser. You can run the code cells in the notebook.
