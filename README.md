# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-Text-Classification-
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate and build a Naïve Bayes Classifier(NBC) on 
text data without using any external modules i.e., to build from scratch. We are given Ford 
Sentence Classification Dataset[1] (Kaggle link — Ford  Sentence Classification). This dataset 
consists corpus of text data related to 6 different categories. They are Responsibility, 
Requirement, Soft Skill, Experience, Skill and Education. By using Naïve Bayes Classifier, 
given a new sentence we are supposed to find out which type this sentence belongs to using 
bayes theorem.
